This zip file contains code from Chapters 2 through 11 of Professional Swift,
as well as the book's appendix. There are no code samples presented in Chapter
1 of the book, so a folder corresponding to this chapter has been ommitted.

You will need a Mac running OS X and Xcode 6 in order to compile and run these
code samples. You can download Xcode 6 from the Mac App Store if do not already
have it.

Please note that in some cases, certain examples or listings from the chapters
are not included because the example is generated output or code you would
never enter yourself.

We hope you have fun with the sample code we have provided and that you find it
to be useful and informative. Enjoy!
